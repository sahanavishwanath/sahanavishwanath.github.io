                <em> This schematic uses one photoresistor, one blue LED light, and two resistors. To determine
                     which resistors to use for the LED lights, I used Ohm's law. The blue LED light
                     has a 3.3 V drop, and the LEDs run at 20 mA, or 0.02 A. Since the power source was 5 V, I first
                     subtracted 3.3 from 5, to get 1.7 V. I then used Ohm's law (V = I x R), and substituted the
                     appropriate values to get the formula 2.7 V = 0.02 A x R. Then solving for R, I divided 1.7/0.02
                     to get 85 ohms. Although the closest resistor that was above 85 ohms, was the a 100
                     ohm resistor, I chose to use a 1k ohm resistor to be safe. For the photoresistor, I used a
                     10k ohm resistor to prevent short circuiting. </em>
