                <em> This code first initializes the three LED lights to specific outputs. The code then begins a loop
                that continuously runs. First all three LED lights are turned on. Then, after half a second, the red
                LED light is turned off, then after a quarter of a second, the green LED light is turned off, and then
                after another quarter of a second, the yellow LED light is turned off. There is then another half
                second pause before the loop begins again. </em>

                <em> The gif above shows how the circuit operates. Like explained previously in the code,
                all three LED lights turn on, then the red light turns off, followed by the green, then
                yellow light. </em>
