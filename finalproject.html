              <em> This picture shows a box asking the user how they feel, the user can press the 'Okay' button
                   or the 'Stressed' button. If the 'Okay' button is pressed, the lights begin to continuously fade
                   on and off, fading on for 4 seconds, and off for 4 seconds. If the 'Stressed' button is pressed,
                   the lights begin to fade on and off, at first fading on for 2 seconds, and off for 2 seconds, and
                   gradually slowing down until the lights fade on for 4 seconds, and fade off for 4 seconds. </em>

              <em> The comments in the above code describe each line of in the above code in detail. The
                   code initializes various variables as well as sets certain output and input pins. The code
                   then makes two functions to fade the LED lights on and off a various number of times. Following
                   this, the code calls these functions when certain buttons are pressed. </em>
