          <p>
            Some ideas I have for my final project are:
            1. Night light that gets brighter as surrounding lights get darker

            2. Soothing light that turns on with press of button
            - Switches between blue and green light (more soothing colors?)
            - Slowly fades on and off at the speed of deep breathes
          </p>
