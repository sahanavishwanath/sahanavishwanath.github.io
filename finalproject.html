          <h1>Final Project: De-stress Light</h1>
          <h2> Sahana Vishwanath </h2>
          <h3> This page shows all the documentation for my final project, a de-stress light. </h3>
          <br />

          <strong> Concept: </strong>
          <p>
            The concept behind my project stemmed from witnessing and experiencing myself feelings of stress. When
            someone feels stressed, their breathing becomes short and shallow, which then causes more feelings of stress.
            This unhealthy cycle can be broken by practicing deep or controlled breathing. The picture below shows
            further details on both stressed and controlled breathing.
            <br />
            <img src="https://www.calmwithyoga.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Controlled-Breathing-1-1024x1024.png" width="200" height="300"></a>

            <br />

            After doing further research on stress and deep breathing, I wanted to create something that would help faciliate
            deep breathing, as it can be difficult to focus on taking deep breaths when overly stressed. In my experience,
            I have found visual cues to be the most helpful in facilitating deep breathing, such as  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BiIZhRrARj4/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=1nmvz3em6qbcj">this video</a>.
            I decided to create something similar but with a light. My idea was to create a light that would fade on and off
            at the rate of deep breaths, to visually stimulate the user into taking deep, controlled breaths.

              <em> This picture shows a box asking the user how they feel, the user can press the 'Okay' button
                   or the 'Stressed' button. If the 'Okay' button is pressed, the lights begin to continuously fade
                   on and off, fading on for 4 seconds, and off for 4 seconds. If the 'Stressed' button is pressed,
                   the lights begin to fade on and off, at first fading on for 2 seconds, and off for 2 seconds, and
                   gradually slowing down until the lights fade on for 4 seconds, and fade off for 4 seconds. </em>

            <p>
              <em> The schematic shows two buttons, one connected to the A2 port and the other to A3. Both buttons are connected to
                   the 5V power, and each with a 10k ohm resistor. The schematic also displays the LED strip lights connected to the 9 pin
                   with a 10k ohm resistor. All three of the resistors used were chosen to eliminate the amount of current and to prevent short
                   circuiting.  </em>

            <p>
              <em> The enclosure I used to cover the breadboard and all the wires was a carboard box. I first
              opened the box completely and placed the breadboard inside. I then marked where the holes should be
              made in order to see the buttons. I then opened the box again, took the breadbaord out, and cut out two
              square holes, as shown in the first picture above. I put the breadboard back inside the box stacked on top
              of 3 checkbooks to ensure that the buttons on the breadboard would be seen when the box was closed.
              I then taped the box closed, and added the text on the outside, as shown in the second picture above. </em>

              The video shows how the circuit operates when the stressed button is pressed. After
              the button is pressed, the LED lights begin to fade on and off, starting at a fast speed, and gradually
              slowing down to the speed of deep breaths. </em>
