                <em> This schematic uses one pushbutton, two LED lights, and three resistors. To determine
                     which resistors to use for the LED lights, I used Ohm's law. Each of the LED lights
                     have 1.8 V drop, and the LEDs run at 20 mA, or 0.02 A. Since the power source was 5 V, I first
                     subtracted 1.8 from 5, to get 3.2 V. I then used Ohm's law (V = I x R), and substituted the
                     appropriate values to get the formula 3.2 V = 0.02 A x R. Then solving for R, I divided 3.2/0.02
                     to get 160 ohms. I then chose the closest resistor that was above 160 ohms, which was the 220
                     ohm resistors. For the pushbutton, I used a 10k ohm resistor, so that the power was not directly
                     connected to ground. </em>

                <em> The gif above shows how the circuit operates. Once the button is pressed, the green light
                     turns on and slowly fades until it is off, then the red light turns on and slowly fades off. </em>
