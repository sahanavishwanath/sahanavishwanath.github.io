                <em> The comments in the above code describe each line of in the above code in detail. The
                     code initializes various variables as well as sets certain output and input pins. The code
                     then runs through two for loops to display two fading lights. </em>

                <em> The gif above shows how the circuit operates. Once the button is pressed, the green light
                     turns on and slowly fades until it is off, then the red light turns on and slowly fades off. </em>
